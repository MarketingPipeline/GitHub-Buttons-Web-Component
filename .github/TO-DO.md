# To-Do

- [ ] Fix Count Results 

> GitHub API only provides 100 results per page for routes like <code>api.github.com/repos/REPO_NAME/issues</code>(followers & more) & keep fetching results till there is an error etc. Note: reason for followers being required - org type does not provider follower count. 


- [ ] Possibly store fetched JSON for X amount of minutes etc (to avoid hitting API every time a user reloads pages)

- [ ] Add Contributors Count (easy to do - but will wait till all results issues is fixed)
